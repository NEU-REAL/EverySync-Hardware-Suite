------------------------
* Updated message dependencies
* Contributors: Magazino Version Daemon

0.7.7 (2017-04-12 18:46)
------------------------
* Force recompile (blank line CMakeLists.txt)
* Contributors: Marcel Debout

0.7.6 (2017-04-12 11:02)
------------------------
* Tested the auto-exp-upprper-lim and adapted fail output
* Added upper-exp-limit for exp/brightness search
  For dark scenes, the exposure search (to reach a desired brightness) will
  reach high exposure values ( >1s ). This leads to instabillity and
  timeouts. Therefore it's now possible to limit the exposure and fail in
  case the brightness can not be reached.
  The own binary-exp-search takes above limits as bounds.
* Contributors: Marcel Debout

0.7.5 (2017-04-06 16:14)
------------------------
* Improved smart exp search for values < 50
  The own binary search needs an upper bound. This is generated by using
  the default PylonAutoExposure function with a value of 50.
  So an initial setting of the corresponding exposure to a brightness of
  50 will speed up the search.
* Contributors: Marcel Debout

0.7.4 (2017-04-06 09:32)
------------------------
* Updated invalid logo path
* Contributors: Marcel Debout

0.7.3 (2017-03-01)
------------------
* Fix: Installation failed du to return code 2
  udevadm control can return failure ($? != 0)
  When building docker containers, the or true does the trick
* Contributors: plieningerweb

0.7.2 (2017-02-23)
------------------
* Fix: Install udev rules
  Udev Rules usually installed with setup-usb.sh of tar.gz
  Without, camera will not be recognized in Ubuntu stock install
* Contributors: plieningerweb

0.7.1 (2017-02-14)
------------------
* Reviewing beetkeskin PR for GigE gamma
  - Formatted the code (deleted whitespaces)
  - Agreed to the fact that a non-accessible gamma is not always an error,
  so that returning true makes sense
  - Enabling gamma before checking if the NodeMap is available might solve
  the problem
* 0.7.0
* fixed type decive->device
* fix gamma handling for GigE cameras
  When connecting to a GigE camera (aca1920-50gc), the node crashes with "Error while accessing Gamma in PylonCameraImpl<CameraTraitT>": For some camera types, the Gamma settings are not available to the interface as they are handled automatically by the camera itself. This was already partly fixed for some gamma-related function calls, but not for all of them. This fix adds the missing checks. The behaviour is slightly changed: If the gamma is not set via user, gamma remains in auto mode (i.e. controlled by the camera). Once the user tries to set a gamma value, the gamma mode switches to user.

  Lead to a better RaspPI support
* Refactor exposure time search to meet requ
* Add timeout param for brightness adjustment
  Add the optional parameter brightness_timeout to increase
  the time for the brightness search. Modified error massage
  to report the actual timeout.
* Contributors: Marcel Debout, Maxi Maerz

0.6.13 (2016-11-14)
-------------------
* Fixed non-working set gamma for GigE cameras
  Up to now, the setGamma() did not have an influence for GigE cameras,
  because one has to 'EnableGamma' first. Fixed that bug by moving from
  base-class to the usb and gige classes
* Contributors: Marcel Debout

0.6.12 (2016-11-08 17:45)
-------------------------

  brightness is calculated using all pixels and channels
* 0.6.8
* Fix for non-selectable gamma for some GigE cameras
* 0.6.7
* Updated changelog and README.rst
* Changed default behavior (no_ros_enc given)
  Non-provided encoding is indicated via empty string right-now.
  Default values are mono8 and rgb8 which are checked afterwards.
  Moved YUV422 support to 'future work'.
  Still TODO: - Update documentation
  - Fix brightness search that is evaluating various colored
  pixels for now
  See: https://github.com/magazino/pylon_camera/pull/7
  Resolves: AL-87
* First working color image version with Bayer Support
  - Moved imagePixelDepth() and the setEncoding() Method to the base
  implementation.
  - Added functionallity to detect and store the available image encodings from
  the used camera.
  - Added conversion methods to convert between ROS and GenAPI encodings
  Still TODO: - Update documentation
  - Test code with a camera that supports 'rgb8' and 'bgr8'
  - Provide 'bgr8' iamges in case the camera does not support
  'BGR8' but has 'YCbCr422_8' instead
  - Test brightness search
  See: https://github.com/magazino/pylon_camera/pull/7
  Resolves: AL-87
* Updated rectify image to support rgb8 encoding.
  Updated grabImage function to create "img_raw" variable with correct
  format based on current image encoding.
* Updated imageEncoding and imagePixelDepth function
  - Modified imageEncoding function to support RGB8 format.
  - Modified imagePixelDepth function to return correct pixel size based
  on current image encoding.
* Added function to set PixelFormat
  Baed on image_encoding\_ paramter, the function set appropriate
  PixelFormat depending on USB camera or GigE camera.
* Added image_encoding as parameter
  Added image_encoding as one of the parameters defined in yaml file. User
  can choose between "MONO8" and "RGB8".

0.6.6 (2016-10-19)
------------------
* Merged in unstable/super_fast_brightness_search (pull request #2)
  Unstable/super fast brightness search
* Further micro-CleanUP
* CleanUp & Comments
* Downsampling is now working, fixed indices error
* Added brighntness exp LUT, to allow smart search
  Unstable version with lot's of debug output -> to be tested on the robot
* Continued working on the brightness speedup
  Fixed missing starting point offset in index calculation
  Added output to compare both methods
  Added imwrite to investigate the result
* Added idx vector to select subset of pixels
  Idea is that the brightness search does not have to calculate the mean
  of the entire image in every step, furthermore on a supset of pixels.
  Pixels will be selected like this:
  sampled img:   point:                                idx:
  s 0 0 0 0 0 0  a) [(e.x-s.x)*0.5, (e.y-s.y)*0.5]     a.x*a.y*0.5
  0 0 0 d 0 0 0  b) [a.x,           1.5*a.y]           b.y*a.x+b.x
  0 0 0 0 0 0 0  c) [0.5*a.x,       a.y]               c.y*a.x+c.x
  0 c 0 a 0 f 0  d) [a.x,           0.5*a.y]           d.y*a.x+d.x
  0 0 0 0 0 0 0  f) [1.5*a.x,       a.y]               f.y*a.x+f.x
  0 0 0 b 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0 0 e
  Resolves: TORU-1750

* Contributors: Ulrich Klank

0.6.4 (2016-08-24)

0.5.4 (2016-07-26)
------------------
* Merged in user_output (pull request #1)
  User_output
* ros-linted the code, removed tabs
* Made set-user-output working finally! Still have problems, that USB cameras start counting with 1 and GigE-Cameras by 0, but created a workaround
* figured out, that basler enums are of type double, removed num_outputs member and replaced it with a vector containing the UserOutputselectorEnums -> Output '1' can now be set using 'vector.at(1)'
* added function that counts the number of available UserOutputs for the camera, have to test it for other devices
* starting to fix the setDigitalOutput functions for GigE cameras. Added member to the pylon_camera-class where the number of digital user outputs a camera provide will be stored. Still have to think of a way how to get this information, because they are highly dependend the used device and the used enums

0.5.0 (2016-06-23)
------------------
* Fixed a two bugs reported by andermi: Node crashes in case that the camera does not support binning. (fixed by previously checking if this feature is available) and setting the mono8 image encoding before the startGrabbing(), because afterwards it's assumend to be fix.

-------------------------
* compiles without warnings (no return value)
* merged the two branches
* adapted device removal behaviour
* 'is deprecated' error is now a 'is deprecated' warning'
* added deprecated handling of 'set_brightness_srv', 'set_exposure_srv' and 'set_sleeping_srv', which now can be found under 'set_brightness', 'set_exposure' and 'set_sleeping'. Furthermore the usage of 'SetBrightnessSrv.srv', 'SetExposureSrv.srv' and 'SetSleepingSrv.srv' is deprecated and should be switched to 'SetBrightness.srv', SetExposure.srv' and 'SetSleeping.srv'
* implemented setBinning as runtime parameter, but finally realized that the camera does not support it. Hence the camera has to be closed and reopened to be able to set the binning. This will be a future feature
* realized new fast opening behaviour, Basler-Feedback was: Sfnc is outdated, so I replaced it using the DeviceClass and the ModelName. Futhermore its possible to detect the desired camera without opening it twice
* increased fail_safe_ctr for dart cameras -> manual: up to 50 frames needed to reach target for dart cameras
* splitted grabImagesRawActionExecuteCB() in two methods, so that it can also be called from the derived PylonCameraOpenCV class
* moved output to #if DEBUG
* did lots of changes but finally I found a logic behaviour!
* linting & formatting
* added setGamma functionallity
* finally found out that the best is to keep default camera settings as long as possible. Added lots of commands to the default config file, hopefully one can verify my thoughts ;-)
* removed outdated scripts from CMakeLists.txt
* making roslint happy
* removed outdated scripts, brightness tests are coveraged in magazino_tests, exp_caller depends maru stuff
* removed test depend, all tests are done in magazino_tests/pylon_camera_tests
* finally got a state, where brightness tests for usb & gigE are running successfull, have still problems with dart cameras
* 0.0.17
* README.md wurden online mit Bitbucket bearbeitet
* removed has_auto_exposure\_ member, because this happens already in GenAPI::isAvailable(cam\_->ExposureAuto), added getter for cam\_->AutoGainUpper & Lower limit, added throwing of std::runtime_errors
* searching for autoBrightnessFunction stuck for dart cameras
* clean up dart
* disabled gainselector setting, because each gige cam has its differen naming
* removed senseless getCurrentExp, Gain... functions, correctly implemented setGain
* removed comments
* calling the grabImagesAction with differen exp-times will no longer affect the continiously published images
* further cleaning
* rows & cols are now size_t, removed unused checkForPylonAutoFunctionRunning()
* cleaning & renaming
* cleaned up the extended brightness search, works now very well!
* setExposure() on the pylon_camera-Object (not on PylonCameraNode) has now target and reached exposure
* enabled output
* fixed GainType-bug
* moved exp_search_params, continued working on brightness fix, still problems with dart
* CMakeLists.txt formatted
* dart camera starts with the same settings like the usb camera
* not all usb cameras have GainSelector_AnalogAll
* formatting
* seperated registerConfig, openCamera and applyStartupSettings
* added output regarding gain and exposure time, facing to problems in difference of usb and dart cams
* gain setting started, checking if gain db range gige equals usb
* check if auto function running not necessary any more
* brightness search now in a seperate thread, added lots of comments (and outpouts which i will remove when the gain stuff is working)
* removed auto-functions parameter limits for gige cameras
* gain for dart cameras not hard coded any more, one can set it in initializeing process using the ros-params
* changed order of setting target brightness value & setting the auto-funktion mode
* try to get rid of all these checkForAutoFuncitonRunning() functions using only one PylonCamera::isBrightnessFunctionRunning() method
* - output to check if auto-function still running
* - added const max allowed delta (tolerance) for the brightness search
  - switched from int-mean to float mean to decrease rounding errors
  - added comments / better readability
* further comments for brightness search
* 0.0.16
* Basler-Feedback: Prevent that the image will be copied twice:
  "
  Es handelt sich um ein Missverstndnis. Bei dem Ausdruck image = std::vector<uint8_t>(pImageBuffer, pImageBuffer + img_size_byte\_); passiert folgendes:
  1.  Konstruktor von std::vector<uint8_t>(pImageBuffer, pImageBuffer + img_size_byte\_) aufrufen (1. Kopie der Bildaten)
  2.  Zuweisungsoperator von image aufrufen (2. Kopie der Bildaten)
  3.  Destruktor von std::vector<uint8_t>() aufrufen (1. Kopie wird verworfen)
  Der Compiler hat unter Umstnden die Mglichkeit hier zu optimieren, wenn die verwendete STL und der Compiler C++11 untersttzt. Da ab C++11 der Move Assignment operator (In der Mail stand Move Constructor) verfgbar ist (class_name & class_name :: operator= ( class_name && ) und der Compiler wei das der R-Value std::vector<uint8_t>() nicht weiter referenziert wird, kann er einen Kopierschritt vermeiden.
  Vorschlag, einfach folgenden Ausdruck:
  image.assign(pImageBuffer, pImageBuffer + img_size_byte\_);
  statt:
  image = std::vector<uint8_t>(pImageBuffer, pImageBuffer + img_size_byte\_);
  verwenden und das Problem ist erledigt.
  "
* removed brightnessValidation() because it's a one-liner
* activated new waitForCamera() function
* added waitForCamera(), which waits for pylon_camera\_->isReady() observing a given timeout
* comment on isReady()
* Basler-Email: cam\_->GetNodeMap().InvalidateNodes() should never be necessary, so I removed it
* resorted methods
* added comments
